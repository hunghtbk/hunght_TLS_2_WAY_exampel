# Server certificate and key generation method
II----Generate server key and certificate to be signed step by step
# openssl genrsa -aes256 -passout pass:server -out server_rsa_private.pem 2048
# openssl req -new -key server_rsa_private.pem -passin pass:server -out server.csr -subj "/C=CN/ST=GD/L=SZ/O=COM/OU=NSP/CN=SERVER/emailAddress=youremail@qq.com"
# Use CA certificate and key to sign server certificate:

openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca_rsa_private.pem -passin pass:123456 -CAcreateserial -out server.crt


=> openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca_rsa_private.pem -CAcreateserial -out server.crt

# Convert the encrypted RSA key to the unencrypted RSA key, so as to avoid requiring the input of decryption password every time reading
# Password is the passout set when generating the private key file and the passin to be entered when reading the private key file. For example, enter "server" here
openssl rsa -in server_rsa_private.pem -out server_rsa_private.pem.unsecure
